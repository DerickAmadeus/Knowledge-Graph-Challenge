Carol is a quiet researcher who prefers deep conversations. She works at the university library, 
where she meticulously catalogs rare manuscripts and historical documents. Carol is highly 
organized and always triple-checks her work before submitting reports.

Despite her introverted nature, Carol collaborates well with her colleague David, who is a 
talkative historian. They often discuss complex theories about ancient civilizations during their 
lunch breaks. While David leads presentations to large audiences, Carol prefers one-on-one 
mentoring sessions with students.
